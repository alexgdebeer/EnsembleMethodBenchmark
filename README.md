# TODO:

 - Fix the noise?
 - Use finer timestepping for fine model
 - Should I rescale the state information at some point, and / or use separate bases for each time period?
 - BAE stuff
 - Think about using different bases at different times as part of the POD?
 - Check how POD errors were quantified in other studies
 - Interpolate the permeabilities better
