# BayesianInferenceBenchmark

A comparison between the posterior distributions generated by several methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and the posterior characterised using Markov chain Monte Carlo, for a subsurface flow problem.

## TODO:

EKI:
 - Add localisation. 
 - Add better printing.

EnRML:
 - Move code into repository.
 
LMAP: 
 - Finish writing up description of algorithm.
 - Record number of PDE solves.

MCMC: 
 - Finish checking convergence diagnostics.

Plotting:
 - a lot...

RTO:
 - Finish reading papers and implement the algorithm.
