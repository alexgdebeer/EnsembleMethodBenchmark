# Ensemble Methods: a Benchmark Study

![Problem Setup](problem_setup.png)

This repository contains code written to provide a comparison between the posterior distributions generated by several methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and the posterior characterised using Markov chain Monte Carlo (an exact sampling method), for a high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problem.

In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the spatially varying log-permeability field (parametrised using a Gaussian random field with a Whittle-Matérn covariance function) of a two-dimensional single-phase oil reservoir, using noisy pressure measurements recorded at a set of production wells. 
The figure at the top of the document shows the locations of the production wells, the log-permeability of the reservoir, and the pressure at well 8 (the black line denotes the true pressure and the dots denote the noisy observations).

The benchmark posterior is generated using the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson MCMC sampler [[1](#1)]. 
These results can then be compared to the approximations of the posterior generated using a number of approximate methods, including ensemble randomised maximum likelihood [[2](#2)], ensemble Kalman inversion [[3](#3), [4](#4)], and the ensemble Kalman sampler [[5](#5), [6](#6)].

It may not be straightforward to adapt the implementations of the algorithms in this repository to work with different forward problems. 
If you are interested in applying ensemble methods in a different context, you might like to check out [EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl](https://github.com/clima/ensemblekalmanprocesses.jl), which provides robust, model-independent implementations of a range of ensemble methods.

## Getting Started

First, install Julia >= 1.9.0.
Clone the repository, then create an environment with the project dependencies by running the following in the Julia REPL:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
You should then be able to run any of the scripts in the top level of the repository.
