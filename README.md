# BayesianInferenceBenchmark

A comparison between the posterior distributions generated by several methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and the posterior characterised using Markov chain Monte Carlo, for a subsurface flow problem.

## Getting Started

The code in this repository has been tested using Julia 1.9.0, though other versions of Julia will likely work too. Once you have downloaded and opened the repository, create an environment with the project dependencies by running the following:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
You should then be able to run any of the scripts in the top level of the repository.

## TODO:

EKI:
 - Currently looking good.

EnRML:
 - Experiment with convergence tolerances.

EKS:
 - Add localisation? (SEC, Lee 2021)
 - Read paper on ALDI, and consider using the generalised square root.
 - Split into EKS (uncorrected) and ALDI (corrected).
 
LMAP: 
 - Record number of PDE solves.

MCMC: 
 - Run a longer set of chains.
 - Finish checking convergence diagnostics.

RTO:
 - Finish reading papers and implement the algorithm.

General:
 - Set up a framework for comparing the results of MCMC and the other methods.
 - Save everything to files.
 - Save the number of iterations everything is doing.
