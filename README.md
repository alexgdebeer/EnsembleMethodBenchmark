## Simulation Intensive Inference

TODO: 
 - Clean up all plotting functions.
 - Make covariance matrix notation consistent.
 - Clean up the f, g, H functions.
 - Split methods into several files.
 - Investigate what is going on with the EnKF for the LV Model when there is a large sample size.
 - Think about how matrix inversions / (truncated) SVD should be carried out in the ensemble Kalman methods.
 - Compute the EnKF update more efficiently? (Wang2010, p. 3)
 - Think about trucated SVD when computing inverse of matrix in Kalman gain.
