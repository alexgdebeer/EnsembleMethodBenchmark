# BayesianInferenceBenchmark

A comparison between the posterior distributions generated by several methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and the posterior characterised using Markov chain Monte Carlo, for a subsurface flow problem.

## TODO:

EKI:
 - 

EnRML:
 - Finish adding localisation options.

EKS:
 - Finish writing code.
 
LMAP: 
 - Record number of PDE solves.

MCMC: 
 - Run a longer set of chains.
 - Finish checking convergence diagnostics.

RTO:
 - Finish reading papers and implement the algorithm.

General:
 - Set up a framework for comparing the results of MCMC and the other methods.
 - Save everything to files.
