# BayesianInferenceBenchmark

A comparison between the posterior distributions generated by several methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and the posterior characterised using Markov chain Monte Carlo, for a subsurface flow problem.

## TODO:

 - RTO: finish reading papers and implement.
 - MCMC: finish checking convergence diagnostics.
 - EKI: add better printing.
 - Plotting: plot predictive UQ for all methods.
 - LMAP: finish writing up description of algorithm.
 - LMAP: record number of PDE solves.
